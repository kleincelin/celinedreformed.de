 <br><br>
 Celin Aubele, stage name Celined, is a German music producer, composer, songwriter, photographer, graphic-designer, author, poet, and audio technician.
<br><br>
Her genres are electronic, ambient, noise, and minimalist. Modular Synthesis, tedious audio recordings, and the Organ are Celin's main sources of inspiration, followed by the great Bjork and many other individuals e.g. Mika Vainio, Autechre, trentemoller, SOPHIE, Aja Ireland, Sarah Belle Reid, Jon Hopkins, and Arca.
<br><br>
Her goal is to make a change on this planet, with activistic music, made to raise awareness; if it's our environment, society, or human rights - Celin intertwines that torch into her music and other creative areas, bound to the deep emotions inside her. Polina Tschikmarov, or PolkaTschik - Celin's fellow best friend - helps out on almost all of Celin's projects, ensuring the final magical spark to finish off a project.

"Music is powerful enough to make Cover Art obsolete, the same way Cover Art is powerful enough to make the Music obsolete. Though true power lies in the resonance between the two, resulting in an immaculate sonic and visual experience. Music and Art are just light and sound waves, yet possess the true power of emotionally changing a person's view of the world. Creativity will always make someone feel something, regardless the tools you used or the time you invested. When you have an Idea, flesh it out to the extend you wish and don't let yourself be limited to or intimidated by what already exists." - Celin Aubele
